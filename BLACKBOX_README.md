# hola3.cpp

This is a simple C++ program that prints "Hello World" to the console.

## Step-by-step explanation

The first line includes the `<iostream>` header file. This header file contains the `cout` and `cin` functions, which are used to print output to the console and read input from the console, respectively.

The second line uses the `using namespace std;` statement. This statement tells the compiler to use the functions and classes from the `std` namespace. This means that you can use the `cout` and `cin` functions without having to prefix them with `std::`.

The third line defines the `main()` function. This is the entry point of the program.

The fourth line uses the `cout` function to print the string "Hello World" to the console.

The fifth line uses the `endl` function to insert a newline character into the output stream. This causes the next output to be printed on a new line.

The sixth line returns 0 from the `main()` function. This indicates that the program has terminated successfully.

## Running the program

To run the program, you can use the following steps:

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Navigate to the directory where the `hola3.cpp` file is located.
3. Type the following command:

```
g++ hola3.cpp -o hola3
```

This will compile the program and create an executable file named `hola3`.

4. Run the program by typing the following command:

```
./hola3
```

This will print the following output to the console:

```
Hello World
```
```
